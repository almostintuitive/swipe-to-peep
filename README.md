###Disclaimer
Don’t ever use any of the hacky solutions I’ve used here in your production code, or Jonathan Ive will come around and redesign your face into an aluminium ball with a blinking light.
You need the UIViewControllerTransition API and all that shit.
It’s fine, you can do it. I know it’s confusing, but nice people wrote <link>wrappers <link>around it. Minus one horrible API you need to learn!
